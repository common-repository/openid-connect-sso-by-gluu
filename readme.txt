== Description ==
= OpenID Connect Single Sign-On (SSO) Plugin By Gluu =
This plugin enables user enrollment and authentication against any standard OpenID Provider (OP). In order for this plugin to work, you will need:

1) To run a local instance of the oxd OAuth 2.0 client service (commercial software). There are oxd plugins, modules, and extensions for many popular open source platforms and frameworks, including: Wordpress, Magento, OpenCart, SugarCRM, SuiteCRM, Drupal, Roundcube, Spring Framework, Play Framework, Ruby on Rails and Python Flask. 

[Get a license for oxd](http://oxd.gluu.org). 

2) A standard OP that will handle user authentications. If you need an OP you should consider deploying the free open source Gluu Server. 

= Login =
This plugin enables a WordPress site to send users to an external OpenID Provider for login.

= Enrollment = 
If the user has an existing account in the OP, but not in WordPress, this plugin will enable dynamic registration of the user in WordPress. 

= Single Sign-On (SSO) =
By leveraging a central identity provider (IDP) for authentication you can enable single sign-on (SSO) to other web properties that rely on the same authentication system.

= Features =
*    Easy to use WordPress admin UI
*    Bypass the local WP login page and send users straight to the OP for authentication
*    Choice between automatic and role based new user enrollment
*    Assign a universal role to new users that authenticate against the OP
*    Request any authentication mechanism and user scopes made available by the OP
